# This experimental feature enables stable API to be released in version 1.0 of Multi Test.
# We created this feature to provide as soon as possible a deeper insight into the Multi Test API 1.0.
# Until version 1.0 of Multi Test is officially released, please consider this feature as experimental
# and a subject to change at any time.
# DO NOT enable this feature while testing production ready smart contracts.
